# Unselected-button
This is a small project
There is a Jlabel which asks a questions where the user has to select one of the buttons in order to give a response to the question made before. However the project only admits one response " yes" since the button with the " no " word moves trough the jpanel making impossible to select that answer. This program works with java swings, action events and action listeners.
